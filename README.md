# SmartIrrigationControlSystem
Designed on a custom-designed PCB using Proteus, integrating sensors, actuators, STM32, multivoltage rails, and display components to automate valve switching across irrigation zones. Used HAL to coordinate PWM, UART, ADC, and EXTI. Implemented timer-driven scheduling, RPM sensing, and interrupt-based logic.
